Welcome to *self*.**boost** , a collection of information, both related and unrelated, gathered as I work through various software resources. My name is [Brandon Wilkins](https://github.com/wilkinsb) - I'm a Software Engineer based in <span style="color:blue">Seattle, WA</span>.

As I slowly slog through the library of books and tutorials I've gathered over the years, I'll be creating and updating blog posts to capture my thoughts. While I cannot guarantee the quality of the posts and information here, I can promise that none of it will be *intentionally* misleading or incorrect. Some posts will be better/more informative than others, some will receive more time and attention, and it will probably be obvious when I am not enjoying a book- However I will do my best to portray each source accurately and fairly, no matter my opinion.

I don't anticipate much traffic on the site; as such, my posts will not be directed at an audience. They will *(hopefully)* be styled more along the lines of note-taking, and may read like a textbook at times. I'll still do my best to keep the quality high, and if you find you have a use for the information provided here, feel free to use it (but be sure to cite your source! Thank you!).

This site is built using a couple of tools:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - A static site builder that allows for blog-style posts using `Markdown`
* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) - A `jekyll` theme template
* [Github](https://github.com) - Web-based hosting service for Version control using `Git`
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Create your own static site, hosted on Github!
